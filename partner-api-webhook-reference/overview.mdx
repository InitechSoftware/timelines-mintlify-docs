# PartnerAPI Webhooks

PartnerAPI Webhooks notify your platform in real-time when important events occur across the workspaces you manage. Monitor quota usage, track WhatsApp account connections, and stay informed about API token changes — all without polling.

These webhooks are separate from the PublicAPI Webhooks. While PublicAPI Webhooks cover message-level and chat-level events within a single workspace, PartnerAPI Webhooks focus on workspace-level operational events relevant to platform administrators and resellers.

## Available events

### Workspace quota events

Get alerted when your managed workspaces approach or hit their usage limits. These events enable proactive billing management and prevent service interruptions.

| Event | Trigger | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Seats fully utilized | All seats in use | Every purchased seat in the workspace is occupied — no more users can be added |
| Messaging quota at 90% | Nearing message limit | The workspace has used 90% or more of its messaging quota for the current billing period |
| Messaging quota at 100% | Message limit reached | The workspace has exhausted its messaging quota — new messages will be blocked |
| Transactions quota exhausted | Transaction limit reached | All available transactions for the workspace have been consumed |
| API calls quota at 100% | API call limit reached | The workspace has used 100% of its Public API call quota for the current billing period |

### WhatsApp account events

Track when WhatsApp numbers are connected or disconnected across your managed workspaces.

| Event | Trigger | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Account connected | WhatsApp linked | A user successfully connected a WhatsApp account by scanning a QR code |
| Account disconnected | WhatsApp unlinked | A WhatsApp account was disconnected (manually or automatically) |

### API token events

Monitor security-sensitive changes to Public API tokens.

| Event | Trigger | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Token rotated | Public API token changed | A workspace's Public API token was rotated via the Partner API |

## Use case examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Proactive quota management" icon="gauge-high">
    Prevent service disruptions by acting on quota warnings before limits are reached.

    1. Subscribe to the 90% messaging quota event
    2. When triggered, notify your customer that they are approaching their limit
    3. Offer an upsell or auto-upgrade their plan
    4. If the 100% event fires, display a warning in your UI and queue messages for later
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Automated billing & usage tracking" icon="receipt">
    Keep your billing system in sync with actual resource consumption.

    1. Subscribe to all quota events (seats, messaging, transactions, API calls)
    2. Log each event with the workspace ID and timestamp
    3. Trigger billing adjustments, overage charges, or plan upgrades automatically
    4. Generate usage reports for your customers
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Onboarding status tracking" icon="list-check">
    Know instantly when a customer's WhatsApp account is ready.

    1. After generating a QR code via the Partner API, subscribe to the `account connected` event
    2. When the event fires, update your onboarding flow to mark WhatsApp as connected
    3. Trigger welcome messages or next-step guides for the customer
    4. Monitor for disconnections and prompt users to reconnect
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Security monitoring" icon="shield-halved">
    Track API token changes and account access across all workspaces.

    1. Subscribe to the `token rotated` event to audit all token changes
    2. Log which workspaces had tokens rotated and when
    3. Subscribe to account disconnection events to detect unexpected access changes
    4. Alert your security team if a workspace loses its WhatsApp connection unexpectedly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Payload example

When a workspace's messaging quota reaches 90%, your endpoint receives:

```json
{
  "event_type": "workspace:messaging_quota:90",
  "data": {
    "workspace_id": 12345,
    "quota_limit": 10000,
    "quota_used": 9150,
    "billing_period_end": "2024-02-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Best practices

- **Act on 90% warnings** — don't wait for the 100% event. Proactively notify customers or auto-scale their plans.
- **Log all events** — maintain an audit trail of all webhook events for billing reconciliation and support troubleshooting.
- **Monitor account connectivity** — WhatsApp disconnections can disrupt your customer's business. React to disconnection events quickly.
- **Secure token rotation** — when you receive a `token rotated` event, update any cached tokens in your system immediately.
