# Partner API

The TimelinesAI Partner API is designed for platform integrators, resellers, and SaaS providers who need to provision and manage multiple TimelinesAI workspaces on behalf of their customers. It lets you automate workspace creation, user management, WhatsApp account onboarding, and API token lifecycle — all without requiring your customers to interact with the TimelinesAI dashboard directly.

<Info>
  The Partner API uses a separate authentication token from the Public API. Contact [support@timelines.ai](mailto:support@timelines.ai) to obtain Partner API credentials.
