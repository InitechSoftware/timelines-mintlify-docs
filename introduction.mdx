## Our APIs

TimelinesAI provides two complementary APIs and their webhook systems, each designed for different audiences and use cases.

### Public API

The Public API is your primary interface for managing WhatsApp communications within a single workspace. Use it to send and receive messages, manage chats, upload files, organize conversations with labels, and subscribe to real-time webhook events.

**Best for:** Businesses integrating WhatsApp into their own workflows — CRMs, support systems, marketing tools, and custom applications.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Partner API

The Partner API is designed for platform integrators, resellers, and SaaS providers who manage multiple TimelinesAI workspaces on behalf of their customers. It lets you automate workspace provisioning, user management, WhatsApp onboarding, and API token lifecycle.

**Best for:** Partners building white-label solutions, managed services, or multi-tenant platforms on top of TimelinesAI.

## Rate limits & credits

Messages sent via API consume credits from your messaging quota:

| Action                  | Credits  |
| ----------------------- | -------- |
| Text message            | 1        |
| Message with attachment | 2        |
| Failed message          | Refunded |

Messages are sent with a ~2 second delay between each to comply with WhatsApp guidelines. [Contact support](mailto:support@timelines.ai) to customize this on Business plans.
