# Public API

The TimelinesAI Public API gives you full control over your WhatsApp workspace. Send and receive messages, manage conversations, handle file attachments, organize chats with labels, and set up real-time webhooks — all through a simple REST API.

## Base URL

```
https://app.timelines.ai/integrations/api

All requests require Bearer token authentication. See [Authentication](/authentication) for details.
